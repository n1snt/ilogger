# README Maintenance Rule

**ALWAYS update the README.md file** when making any of the following changes:
- Adding new constructor options to `ILogger()` or new configuration parameters to any method
- Adding, removing, or modifying any public method on `ILogger` instance, `LoggerInstance`, or global functions
- Changing method signatures (parameters, return types) or behavior that affects users
- Adding new features or capabilities that users can access
- Changing how existing features work or their behavior
- Adding or modifying exported types from `src/index.ts`
- Changing default values of existing options

Update the relevant sections in the README including API Reference, Constructor Provisions, Features list, and examples as needed.
